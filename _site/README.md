LioranBoard Unofficial Documentation. https://christinna9031.github.io/LBDocumentation/    

This website summarizes all current information about LioranBoard. It can be used both as a (technical) guide for beginners and as a resource for more advanced users. The latest version of LioranBoard is 1.43, so be aware that some details may differ if youâ€™re still running an older version (see bottom right corner of the receiver). We advise updating whenever possible.         
Lioran is the sole creator of LioranBoard, this unofficial documentation serves as sort of an expansion of LioranBoard's original help files.       



Please keep in mind that I manage this site on my own, so it might not be always up to date (although I try to do my best). If you would like to donate to support me, you can do so in the 'Donate' section below. Feel free to contact Christinna#9031 on the LioranBoard Discord server if you are interested in helping it grow or find any bugs. Thank you!
