                        <p>This website summarizes all current information about LioranBoard. It can be used both as a (technical) guide for beginners and as a resource for more advanced users. The latest version of LioranBoard is 1.42y, so be aware that some details may differ if you’re still running an older version (see bottom right corner of the receiver). We advise updating whenever possible.<br>
Lioran is the sole creator of LioranBoard, this unofficial documentation serves as sort of an expansion of LioranBoard's original help files. It's still in progress. If you find any errors, feel free to contact Christinna#9031 on the LioranBoard Discord server.</p>

<h3> About LioranBoard </h3>
<p>Along with being a completely free stream deck, LioranBoard is a very powerful tool that lets your Twitch viewers control and interact with your stream. The software may seem a bit intimidating at first, but the GUI is quite accessible and there are many video guides on the web to get you started. In no time, you’ll make LioranBoard take control of basic things, such as changing scenes automatically or showing custom alerts. Beyond that, the sky is the limit: you can add several commands to the same button to achieve creative and original effects, or even run JavaScript extensions to connect to other apps and services. Learning how to work with LioranBoard is a bit like learning programming, and mastering it means you can make it do almost anything you can imagine.</p> 

<p>LioranBoard is compatible with OBS Studio and has stream decks for both PC and Android. <br>
