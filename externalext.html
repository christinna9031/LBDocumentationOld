                <b>Description: </b>

                Text to Speech extension using Amazon Polly service to turn any text into speech. <b>It works in OBS dock, browser source and external browsers.</b>   <br>
                <b>Preview:</b><br><iframe width="420" height="315"
                src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wazxdYa8XN8?controls=1" allowfullscreen>
                </iframe><br>
                <b>Features:</b>    <br>
         
Text you wish to turn into speech can be sent directly from LioranBoard or your Transmitter (by entering the text or uploading a .txt file). <br>

You can set up your default voice, choosing either neural (more naturally sounding) or standard voice engine. All supported voices can be found <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/voicelist.html" target="_blank">here.</a>  <br> 
You can change pitch, speed and add some effects - you can make it whisper instead of speaking, or use DRC (dynamic range compression).<br>

You can configure a button that will automatically show currently played text. <br>

Playback controls: 
Play and Pause, Skip to Next/Play previous recording, Fast Forward/Backwards, Change Volume, Mute/Unmute.<br><br>
<b>Setup: </b>
<ol>
<li>You need AWS credentials to use this extension. If you do not have an Amazon account, you will need to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank"> sign up</a> for one. Amazon will ask you to verify your identity by providing your phone number and payment method (credit or debit card, some prepaid cards work too). This is needed because AWS provides many other paid services, although we will be using Polly TTS as a part of their free tier. <br>
 Once you have your account, make sure you <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/activate/"> activated the services</a> and follow the steps <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/wheres-my-secret-access-key/" target="_blank">here</a> to get your credentials. As a safety precaution, you might want to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started_create-admin-group.html" target="_blank">create an IAM user</a> and use their credentials instead. <button id="example" onclick="toggle_visibility('awskey')">Show example</button>
 <div id="awskey" style="display: none;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UC4cCaR.png" /><br /></div>
 </li>
 <li>Once you have your credentials, install the extension following these <a href="faq.html#installextensions" target="_blank">steps</a>. In your zip folder you should also see img and lib folders: 
    <ul>
    <li>
    Copy and paste the whole lib folder to the same folder where your Transmitter file resides (most likely in lioranboard folder). 
    <button id="example" onclick="toggle_visibility('lblibfolderx')">Show example</button>
    <div id="lblibfolderx" style="display: none;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6iMbTd9.png" /><br /></div></li>
    <li>Open the img folder, select all the images and copy them all to <code>lioranboard/LioranBoard Receiver(PC)/image</code> folder. </li>
</ul> 
</li>
<li>
In your Receiver, open the premade deck and click on the cogwheel button - edit commands:
<ul>
<li>aws_key = your Access Key ID (from step 1)</li>
<li>aws_secret = your Secret Access Key (from step 1)</li>
<li>voice = choose your default voice. N means it supports both standard and neural engine, NN means it only supports neural engine.</li>
<li>neural = switch between neural and standard engine</li>
<li>region = choose one closest to your location</li>
<li>button_id = button ID you wish to display currently played text (already pre-configured, do not need to change it)</li>
<li>length = max amount of characters per line, will format the displayed text in your button</li>
</ul>
<li>Refresh your Transmitter and click on Play Short examples button to test your credentials. A yellow notification message will pop up in your Receiver if something isn't set up right (follow its instructions). If your credentials are not accepted, go over the previous steps and refresh the Transmitter again. If you get a yellow message saying "Initialize the extension first", press the cogwheel button.</li>
<li>
If you are using the default LB notification system, you can follow the instructions in the Alternate Master Animator button to connect it to your new TTS extension. (will be released in the next LB version)
<button id="example" onclick="toggle_visibility('lbttsnotif')">Show example</button>
<div id="lbttsnotif" style="display: none;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ib5jHeV.png" /><br /></div></li>
<li>Else you can set up your own TTS button triggers (the included example works for <code>!tts *</code> chat trigger).</li>
 <li>Sending a TTS command: </li>
    <ul>
        <li>type = Speak</li>
        <li>voice = default or select a specific one</li>
        <li>neural = switch between neural and standard engine</li>
        <li>pitch = change pitch (only works with standard engine)</li>
        <li>speed = how fast it should speak</li>
        <li>effect: whispered = whispers the text instead of speaking it (supported only by standard engine) <br>
                    drc = dynamic range compression. Makes it easier to hear in noisy environments. <br>
                    soft = makes the voice sound a bit softer (supported only by standard engine)</li>
        <li>value = text you want it to speak</li>

        </li>
    </ul>


 </ol>
<p>
 <b>Playback Controls</b><br>
 

 <ul><li> Play/Resume - play current recording or resume a currently paused one</li>
    <li>Pause - pause currently played recording</li>
<li>Play Previous - play previous recording</li>
<li>Skip to Next - skip to next recording. If there's a new TTS request in the queue, it will skip to that one instead.</li>
<li>Fast Forward/Backwards - you can choose the amount of seconds</li>
<li>Volume Up/Down - you can choose the increments, default is 10% per button press (only affects the TTS itself)</li>
<li>Mute/Unmute - Mutes/Unmutes your TTS (only affects the TTS itself)</li>
<li>Currently playing button - this button will automatically display a currently played TTS </li>
<button id="example" onclick="toggle_visibility('playbackx')">Show example</button>
<div id="playbackx" style="display: none;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/TKPq0Mt.png" /><br /></div>
</ul>



<p>
<b>Additional Information</b><br>
All TTS requests are saved in your local storage, so you can safely come back and replay them later even after rebooting your computer. <br> 

Any new TTS request will start automatically playing after the last one finishes - there is an integrated queue system. If you're in the middle of replaying your old TTS recordings and a new request comes in, you can press the Skip to Next button to immediately start playing the new TTS request or wait for your current recording to finish first. 

You can press Clear Playlist button to delete all saved and current recordings in the queue. This will also automatically refresh your Transmitter.

You can send TTS requests from your Transmitter as well, either as text or by uploading a .txt file. This will use your default TTS settings. 

 

<p>
 <b>Important Notes</b><Br>
 Amazon Polly TTS has a <b>monthly limit</b> of 1 million neural and 5 million standard free characters for the first year of use. After that you can either switch to a new account to refresh the free tier or use a different TTS service. Make sure you keep track of what month you're on. More information can be found <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/polly/pricing/" target="_blank">here</a>. <br>

 To not go over the monthly limit (which is extremely generous unless you want it to read books for you), you can set up a <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/sheets" target="_blank">budget</a> to track and notify you of any extra costs.  <br>
 
 Do not share your AWS credentials or show them on your stream, as you might get billed if you or someone else accidentally uses any of the paid services. Amazon is quite lenient about this though, so you should be able to get a refund in the event something like this happens.

            <b>Description: </b>

            Spotify extension for LioranBoard which allows you to display and control your Spotify playback directly from your Stream Deck.</b>   <br>
            <b>Preview:</b><br><iframe width="420" height="315"
            src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EvPCpGzuypc?controls=1" allowfullscreen>
            </iframe><br>
            <b>Features:</b>    <br>
     
Displays your current track in your OBS overlay, StreamDeck and Transmitter.  <br>

Basic playback controls: Play/Pause, Next/Previous Track, Fast Forward/Backwards, Mute/Unmute, Volume Sliders, Like/Unlike track, Toggle Shuffle.  <br>

Song Request Queue: Adds a new song to the queue (either by its URL or a keyword) and displays the current song request queue in your OBS overlay. Everything updates automatically. There is a command to clear the queue as well.  <br>

Retrieve My Playlists: Retrieves all your (public) playlists and lets you play and cycle through them.  <br>

Search for Playlists by a tag : Retrieves playlists by tag/genre (for example romance, chill, jazz etc.).  <br>

Search for a song by keyword: Can search for a song by its name only or by its name and artist. You can cycle through all the results. <br></p>


<p><b>Prerequisites:</b><br> OBS Websocket 4.9, LioranBoard 1.42 or newer <br></p>
<p><b>Setup:</b>
<p>After downloading the .zip file, place the whole Spotify folder in your <code>lioranboard\LioranBoard Receiver(PC)\Ext</code> folder. Go to your Receiver and install the extension. It should automatically copy all the files, add a new deck and create a new Spotify OBS scene. If, for some reason, the image files do not get copied automatically, you can manually move them from the Spotify/img folder to your Receiver/image folder. <b>Unless the extension was not installed properly in the first place, you do not need to press 'Install Extension' button anymore.</b> <br>
As soon as you install the extension, a new browser window should open where you need to <a href="https://christinna9031.github.io/LioranBoard-Files/Spotify_auth.html">authenticate your Spotify account</a>. Follow all the instructions. <br>
Once your Spotify account is successfully linked, it should automatically show currently playing track in 3 separate locations: your Streamdeck, your Spotify scene in OBS and your Spotify tab in Transmitter. The Spotify tab in Transmitter contains some extra information about the current track. <br></p>
<p> <img id="smallimg" src="https://i.imgur.com/02LT9qQ.png" ><b>INIT button</b> <br>
This button should be automatically initiated every time you restart your Transmitter. You can use it 'wake up' your Spotify extension, as it sometimes goes into sleep mode after some period of inactivity (you can also simply tap play in your Spotify player). <br>
Do not modify any commands here. 
Send to extension input fields: <br>
<ul>
<li><code>credentials</code> - credentials you obtained when you <a href="https://christinna9031.github.io/LioranBoard-Files/Spotify_auth.html">authenticated your Spotify account </a></li>
<li><code>refresh_token</code> - refresh token your obtained when you <a href="https://christinna9031.github.io/LioranBoard-Files/Spotify_auth.html">authenticated your Spotify account</a></li>
<li><code>last_track</code> - do not change</li>
<li><code>device_type </code> (optional) - device type you want to control your Spotify playback on. If set to default, it will pick the first one it can find.</li>
<li><code>device_id</code> (optional) - device ID you want to control your Spotify playback on. It should be displayed in your Spotify tab in your Transmitter. Can leavy empty if you do not have multiple devices of the same type.  </li></ul>

<p><b>Basic Playback Controls</b> <br><img id="middleimg" src="https://i.imgur.com/c8VXkkU.png"><p>
    These should be pretty self-explanatory. <br>
    <b>Play:</b> 
    If <code>value</code> is empty, it will simply resume playing your current track. If <code>value</code> is a track/playlist/album URI, it will switch to playing that instead. <br>
    
    <b>Fast forward/backward</b>: <code>value</code> can be adjusted to how many seconds you want to fast forward/backward. </p>
    <p>

  
    <img style="width:8%;border:0px;vertical-align:middle;" src="https://i.imgur.com/traJ855.png">  <b>Add/Remove a track</b><br>
    Adds/Removes a currently playing track from your library. </p>

   <p> <img style="width:5%;border:0px;vertical-align:middle;" src="https://i.imgur.com/iVxGRST.png"> <b>Song Request </B><br>
     Default Twitch Chat trigger is <code>!sr *</code>. The wildcard accepts these formats: <br>
     <ul>
    <li>Spotify URI: <code>!sr spotify:track:4boaU9XaS1g6U1nV4lEsMl </code></li>
    <li>Spotify Link: <code>!sr https://open.spotify.com/track/4boaU9XaS1g6U1nV4lEsMl?si=mK4Bf7JiS0iMyX4kt57Gkg</code></li>
    <li>Keyword (song name only) <code>!sr Kiss from a rose</code></li>
    <li>Keyword (song name + artist name) <code>!sr Kiss from a rose # Seal</code>- artist name must follow the song name and '#' sign</li> 
         </ul>
    <p>Once you initiate the button, the extension will queue up the track in your Spotify player and add its name to a stack called <code>spotify_queue</code> (if the requested track cannot be found, the entry will be set to "error"). The SR button will then trigger another button which will display your current SR queue in your Streamdeck and your OBS overlay. Once Spotify starts playing the requested song, it will be automatically removed from the queue. <br>
        <img style="width:18%;border:0px;vertical-align:middle;" src="https://i.imgur.com/XbJEtvB.png">
    </p>

    <p><img style="width:5%;border:0px;vertical-align:middle;" src="https://i.imgur.com/5OvHX1H.png">  <b>Get My Playlists </b><br>
        This button will retrieve all your playlists (must be made public) and allow you to cycle through them using Previous/Next playlist button. The playlist URIs are by default saved in a spotify_playlists_uri stack. 


        </p>

        <p><img style="width:5%;border:0px;vertical-align:middle;" src="https://i.imgur.com/IWG0wNd.png">  <b>Playlists By Tags </b><br>
        You can search for playlists by tags. Press GET ALL TAGS button to retrieve all possible tags as it needs to be an exact match. You can then use Previous/Next playlist button to cycle through them. The playlist URIs are by default saved in a spotify_playlists_uri stack.  <br> 
        Default chat trigger is <code>!spotify tag *</code>, for example <code>!spotify tag instrumental</code>. 


        </p>

        <p><img style="width:5%;border:0px;vertical-align:middle;" src="https://i.imgur.com/MFcEvP1.png">  <b>Search by Keyword </b><br>
        Allows you to search for a song by its keyword. Default chat trigger is <code>!spotify search *</code> where the wildcard can be these two formats: 
        <ul>
            <li>Keyword (song name only) <code>!sr Kiss from a rose</code></li>
            <li>Keyword (song name + artist name) <code>!sr Kiss from a rose # Seal</code>- artist name must follow the song name and '#' sign</li>   
        </ul>
        <p>This will retrieve a stack called spotify_tracks_uri with all the matching tracks. The first matching track will be automatically queued up. You can use Next Search Result button to cycle through them. 

        </p>

        <p><img style="width:5%;border:0px;vertical-align:middle;" src="https://i.imgur.com/a0HIao5.png">  <b>Clear Queue </b><br>
        Experimental button. Should be able to clear your Spotify queue. If used while you have song requests in your queue, it will clear those as well. 
        This will temporarily mute your Spotify while the queue is being cleared and unmute it as soon as it's finished. <br>

<p><b>Setup:</b>
<p>You will find a premade INIT button in your deck. Right click on it - Edit commands. 
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/MWdMXB7.png"> <br>
The <code>name</code> value will be your LIFX token which you can retrieve <a href="https://cloud.lifx.com/settings" target="_blank">here</a>. The <code>power_off</code> can be set to true to receive a yellow notification message each time your request is successful, or set to false to only receive error notifications.  </p>
<p>

  INIT, Get Light, Toggle Power, Effects Off, Activate Scene, Clean Mode and Validate Color can be all found under a single extension name <b>LIFX Basics</b>. If the particular input box is not mentioned in the documentation below, it means the command will ignore its value.  </b>
</p>
   <p>
<b>Selectors</b><br>
Selectors are identifiers for addressing one or many lights belonging to the authenticated account. <Br>

Selectors which generally specify multiple lights, <code>all</code>, <code>group</code>, <code>group_id</code>, <code>location</code>, <code>location_id</code>, and <code>scene_id</code>, accept an optional suffix <code>:random</code> which specifies a single random light from that set of lights. e.g. <code>all:random</code>, <code>group:[value]:random</code>, <code>location_id:[value]:random</code>. <br>

    You can combine up to 25 selectors together additively by separating them with <code>,</code>, so if you want to address both a light labelled "Bedroom" and a light labelled "Office", you can use <code>label:Bedroom,label:Office</code> as the selector.

            <b>Description: </b>

            Discord relay is an extension which lets you relay messages from Discord to Twitch and from Twitch to Discord. It can also enable Discord message triggers for LioranBoard. </b>   <br>
            <b>Preview:</b><br><iframe width="420" height="315"
            src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qn1puWHfMYs?controls=1" allowfullscreen>
            </iframe><br></p>
            <p><b>How it works</b><br>
            The extension utilizes both Discord webhook and Discord websocket (which you connect to with a bot token). Your Discord websocket is listening to all Discord chat messages and tells the extension to relay them to your Twitch chat (by using the already existing connection in your Transmitter). <Br> The extension listens to all Twitch chat messages, fires a Discord webhook every 2 seconds and posts them in your Discord channel as either embeds or plain text. <br>
            Since the Discord websocket already listens to all your Discord messages, I implemented a feature that automatically converts them to the same payload Twitch chat uses and sends them to LioranBoard. This means you can use chat triggers from Discord in your LioranBoard. You can also configure which Discord server roles correspond to specific Twitch badges (broadcaster, mod, subscriber, vip).<br>
            When the relay is open, it automatically starts storing and regularly updating all your current Twitch chatters profile image URLs. It can then display their icon in the relayed messages on Discord. <br>
            I have also set up a simple AWS API service which can retrieve all your Discord server emojis and save them into .ini file (this cannot be done from your Transmitter due to CORS and Cloudfare blocking the access). This helps the extension to convert Twitch emojis to Discord emojis and correctly display them when relaying messages from Twitch. <br>

            <li>Fill out your <b>twitch channel name</b> (example: Dashducks). This is where all the Discord messages will be sent to. This is also the channel our relay will be listening to and relaying messages to Discord. You have to be already connected to it (use <a href="https://christinna9031.github.io/LBDocumentation/twitchcommands.html#twitchjoinchannel">Twitch: Join Channel</a> command if needed).</li>

            <li>Scroll up a bit and click on 'Copy'. Open the link in a new browser window and invite the bot to your Discord channel. You can restrict your bot to only see certain channels, otherwise it will be relaying messages from all the channels it can see on your server.  <button id="example" onclick="toggle_visibility('relayx5')">Show example</button>

        Right click on the button - Edit commands. There are already pre-filled values including broadcaster, mod, subscriber and vip. All you need to do is change the role ID. Do not modify anything else. 
        You can retrieve your role ID by going to your Discord server settings - Roles, right clicking on the role name and pressing 'Copy ID' button. Replace the pre-filled ID with your own. Make sure to keep the formatting: <code>"badgename:ROLEID"</code>

       <li>  <p><b class="btnbasic" id="btnaqua">Ignore</b> 
      <p>  You can add any names you do not want to relay the messages from. For example, you might not want to relay messages from your bot accounts. </li>

     <li>   <p><b class="btnbasic" id="btnaqua">Discord Emojis</b> </p>
        <p>This button should retrieve all your custom Discord emojis and save them in <code>DiscordEmojis.ini</code> file in your Receiver folder. If your Twitch viewers use any of the same emojis in the Twitch chat, they will be auto converted and properly displayed in your relayed messages to Discord. <br>
        Do not edit anything in this button. Simply press it and it should do all the work for you. If you decide to make any changes in your .ini file, do not press the button again as it will override any changes you made. </p>
       <p> Note: If your <b>Twitch emojis do not match the Discord ones</b> (= they have a different name), you can open the DiscordEmojis.ini file and manually edit the Twitch emojis part. <br>
        For example, you have a subscriber emoji on Twitch called 'RamsreLord', but your Discord custom emoji's name is 'RamsreFish'. After pressing the button and opening the DiscordEmojis.ini file, the emoji will be stored as <code>'RamsreFish=RamsreFish:EMOJIID'</code>. You want to change the first 'RamsreFish' to 'RamsreLord' as this is the Twitch emoji name which the extension will look for to replace it with the Discord emoji ID.     <button id="example" onclick="toggle_visibility('relayx4')">Show example</button>  <div id="relayx4" style="display: none;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/DCXkCCZ.png" /><br /></div>
       

       <p> <b style="color:red">IMPORTANT:</b> The API cannot see <b>Discord emojis you did not upload yourself manually.</b> If your Discord server emojis come from linking your Discord to your Twitch channel, they will not show up in the list. You can fix this in two ways: 
        <ol>
        <li>Manually reupload all the externally linked emojis on your Discord server and press the Discord Emojis button again. They should now all show up in your DiscordEmojis.ini file.</li>
        <li>Manually change the DiscordEmojis.ini file to add your externally linked emojis: <br>
        <ol>
        <li>In your Discord server, insert the emoji you want to add in the message window, type <code>:\</code> before the emoji and hit enter. The emoji will be displayed as <code><:EMOJI_NAME:ID></code>.</li>
        <li>Add a new category (if it doesn't exist already) <code>[default_emojis]</code> to your DiscordEmojis.ini file. </li>
        <li>Add a new line to your DiscordEmojis.ini file in this format: [number]="TWITCH_EMOJI_NAME=DISCORD_EMOJI_NAME:DISCORD_EMOJI_ID". (remember to start from 0)</li>
        <li>Add or change size to reflect the amount of new emojis you added. For example, <code>size="1"</code> if you have a single emoji. Save the file. </li>
        <li>Restart your Transmitter or press relay close, set params and open relay button again. </li>
        <li>Your newly added emojis should now be correctly displayed.</li>
        </ol>

Please note that you need to be already connected to Twitch chat with the channel you specified in your 'set params' button.  
=======
         </p>

         <p><b>Ignore button</b><br>
        You can add any names you do not want to relay the messages from. For example, you might not want to relay messages from your bot accounts. 

        <p><b>Discord Emojis button</b><br>
        This button should retrieve all your custom Discord emojis and save them in <code>DiscordEmojis.ini</code> file in your Receiver folder. If your Twitch viewers use any of the same emojis in the Twitch chat, they will be auto converted and properly displayed in your relayed messages to Discord. <br>
        Do not edit anything in this button. Simply press it and it should do all the work for you. If your Twitch emojis do not match the Discord ones (= they have a different name), you can open the DiscordEmojis.ini file and manually edit the Twitch emojis part. <br>
        For example, you have a subscriber emoji on Twitch called 'RamsreLord', but your Discord custom emoji's name is 'RamsreFish'. After pressing the button and opening the DiscordEmojis.ini file, the emoji will be stored as <code>'RamsreFish=RamsreFish:EMOJIID'</code>. You want to change the first 'RamsreFish' to 'RamsreLord' as this is the Twitch emoji name which the extension will look for to replace it with the Discord emoji ID.     <button id="example" onclick="toggle_visibility('relayx4')">Show example</button><br>
       <i>
     Note: Press this button only once, as it will always override any values you have edited in the .ini file.</i> </p>

     <p><b>Buttons to control the Relay: </b>
     <ul>
     <li>Pressing <b>'Relay Open'</b> button will connect you to Discord and start relaying messages between Discord and Twitch. You should see a yellow notification message 'Connected to Discord! Listening to messages' (you can also check the connection status in your Transmitter - Discord Relay tab). Please note that you need to be already connected to Twitch chat with the channel you specified in your 'set params' button.

    If you click on the button - Edit commands, you can edit the following values: 
    <ul>
    <li>
    <b>status</b> - enable, disable, triggers only 
    </li>    
    <li>
    <b>oauth_token</b> - your Twitch token. Should be already pre-filled, no need to change it.  
    </li>
    <li><b>discord_trigger</b> - whether you want to enable Discord chat message triggers</li>
    <li><b>discord_mode</b> - pretty (each relayed Twitch chat message will be embed displaying the viewer's profile picture and the sidebar will match the user's Twitch color) vs. simple (all relayed messages are posted as plain text). <br>Please note that there's a limit to how many messages and embeds the webhook can send. If your Twitch chat gets spammed with a lot of messages, it will automatically switch to simple mode to keep up.  </li>

     <p><b class="btnbasic" id="btnblue">Relay Trigger Only</b> </p> <p>Pressing this button will connect you to Discord and start listening to Discord chat triggers only (will not relay messages). These triggers will be converted to your regular Twitch chat triggers (including roles converted to badges, so you can make a button that only a 'mod' role can trigger). There is a '!test from Discord' button to demonstrate how to use it. Just type !test in your Discord channel after pressing the button and it should trigger it.

     <h3 id="Googlesheets">Google Sheets (NOT RELEASED)</h3>
     <p><b>Creator: </b>Christinna<br>
     <b>Download: <a href="https://christinna9031.itch.io/">Itch.io</a></b><br>
     <b>Description: </b>
     Google Sheets is an extension which lets you retrieve and modify data in your Google Sheets.  <br>
     <b>Available commands:</b>  
    <ul><li>Get Data, Append Data, Update Data, Batch Update, Copy Paste, Clear Data </li>
    <li>Auto Fill, Auto Sort, Randomize, Find and replace, Delete Duplicates, Split text into columns </li>
    <li>Merge Cells, Unmerge Cells, Insert Range, Delete range</li>
    <li>Create Spreadsheet, Duplicate Sheet, Add Sheet</li></ul>
   
     <b>Preview:</b><br><iframe width="420" height="315"
     src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XXX?controls=1" allowfullscreen>
     </iframe><br></p>
     <p><b>How it works</b><br>
     The extension utilizes Google Sheets API endpoints to read and write data. <br>
     While reading data is easy, as it only requires an API key, writing data is a bit more complex. The extension ulitizes a custom made AWS Rest API to retrieve your refresh token, as this is only possible server-side and cannot be done from your Transmitter.  <br>
     Exchanging refresh token for a temporary access token is also retrieved through the same API, as it would otherwise expose my Google Cloud Project credentials and could be potentially abused. <br> 
     AWS API Gateway is secure and encrypted, your credentials are simply passed to Google Sheets API and never collected or stored. <br>
     <p><i>Note for other devs: If you would like to use your own project credentials instead, you will need a bit of Google Cloud and JS coding knowledge, but it is possible to edit the extension for this purpose. I have added comments inside the .lbe file on what modifications to make and some very basic explanation on how to retrieve your refresh token. </i> </p>
     </p>
     <p><b>Setup:</b> </p>
     <ol>
     <li><b>Install the extension:</b> Follow <a href="https://christinna9031.github.io/LBDocumentation/setup.html#extensions">this link</a> to properly install the extension.</li>

        <p><b>Parameters</b><br>
        A lot of buttons share the same parameters, which are going to be skipped in the Buttons section below: 
        <ol>
        <li> <code>SpreadsheetID</code> - you can either fill it out manually for each button or set up spreadsheetID variable in your INIT button if you intend to use a single Spreadsheet. <br> 
        Spreadsheet ID can be retrieved by going to your spreadsheet in the browser and copying it from the URL: 'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/YOURSPREADSHEETID/edit?usp=sharing'</li>
        <li><code>SheetName</code> - name of the particular Sheet you want to Get or Edit data in. <Br>
         <b>Important:</b> The extension automatically converts your sheet name to your sheet ID to make it easier to work with. If you rename a sheet to another sheet's name that previously existed in your SpreadSheet (i.e. Sheet1 becomes Sheet2 and Sheet2 becomes Sheet1), you must completely close and reopen Transmitter to reset your session. Otherwise it will still assign the old sheet ID to the name. 
        </li>
        <li><code>Range</code> - range you wish to Get or Edit data in, such as A1:B10.</li>
        <li><code>Dimension</code> - major dimension to Get or Edit data in. <br> For example, if you use the Get Data command and set the range to A1:B10 and your dimension to ROWS, it will return 10 stacks, each containing one row (first stack will be A1-B1 values, second one A2-B2 values, etc.). However, if you change your dimension to COLUMNS, it will return 2 stacks, each containing 1 column (first stack will be A1-A10 values and second stack will have B1-B10 values). 
        </li>
   

        <li><code>Values</code>(applies to Append Data, Update Data and Batch Update commands) - you can send values to the extension in two diffent ways: 
        <ol>
        <li>A string of values separated by | marking individual cells. For example, if you want to insert values in A1:A7 range (make sure dimension is COLUMNS), you can enter them like this: <code>Monday|Tuesday|Wednesday|Thursday|Friday|Saturday|Sunday</code>. Result: <br> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Nv05PeI.png"></li>
        <li>A stringified stack. All values from the stack will be inserted into the selected range, starting from position 0 and ending with the last position. <br>
        <ol>
        <li>Create a stack with some entries.</li>
        <li>Use Stack: Stringify command.</li>
        <li>Use String: Replace command on the newly stringified stack. Replace <code>"</code> with <code>'</code></li>
        <li>Insert the stringified stack variable in the Values field.</li>
        </ol>
        </li>
        </ol>     
        </li>
        </ol>
        

      <p>  <b>Buttons:</b><br>
       <p> <b class="btnbasic" id="btnblue">Get Data</b> 
       <p> Retrieves data based on the range and dimension, and saves them into a stack. <br>
        <ul>
            <li><code>Render</code> - How values should be represented in the output. Default is <a href="https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/ValueRenderOption">formatted value.</a></li>
        <li><code>Delete Empty</code> - whether to delete empty values before putting them into the stack. </li>
        <li><code>StackName</code> - base name of the stack for the retrieved data. For a base name 'My Stack' and request for data from 2 columns, you will get back 'My Stack1' and 'My Stack2' stacks, each containing 1 row of values. </li>

        <button id="example" onclick="toggle_visibility('sheetget')">Show example</button>
        <div id="sheetget" style="display: none;"><img src=" https://i.imgur.com/PKYyDdq.png" /><br /></div></li>
    </ul>

        <p> <b class="btnbasic" id="btnyellow">Append Data</b> 
        <p>Appends values to a spreadsheet. The range is used to search for existing data and find a "table" within that range. Values will be appended to the next row of the table, starting with the first column of the table.</p>
        <p> Please note you can append values either to rows or columns, but not both in the same command. This is to avoid any user erros as it would require more complex inputs.
        <ul>
            <li><code>inputType</code> - How the data should be interpreted. Default is <a href="https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/ValueInputOption">User Entered.</a> </li>
        <li><code>InsertType</code>How the input data should be <a href="https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/spreadsheets.values/append#InsertDataOption">inserted</a>.</li>
        <button id="example" onclick="toggle_visibility('sheetappend')">Show string column example</button>
        <button id="example" onclick="toggle_visibility('sheetappend2')">Show stack row example</button>
        <div id="sheetappend" style="display: none;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FgaAs16.png" /><br /></div></li>
        <div id="sheetappend2" style="display: none;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/eKuBZYD.png" /><br /></div></li>

        </ul>

        <p> <b class="btnbasic" id="btnorange">Update Data</b>   
       <p> Same as Append Data command, except it will update (=overwrite) data in the selected range instead of appending them. <br>
        <code>batchID</code> should be left empty as it is only used if you're doing a Batch Update request.
        <p> <b class="btnbasic" id="btnpink">Batch Update</b>  <br> 
       <p> This is a very important button to understand if you want to perform update data batch requests. Want to Update Data in multiple rows or columns at once? Instead of sending multiple single requests, use Batch Update button instead. <br> Please remember that you share write request quota with all other users using the extension, so try your best to group up your Update Data requests. 
        <ol>
        <li>Send 'Google Sheets Batch Update' command and specify the number of requests and their ID.</li>
        <li>Use the same BatchID for your all following Update Data requests and send them as you normally would.</li>
        </ol>
       <p> The extension will queue them up and wait for the last request to send them all at once. If you fail to supply all requests within the next 10 seconds, the queue will be deleted and resetted. Simply said, either all requests are sent or none.
