                    <p>  LioranBoard can be very time consuming to learn. If you have an idea you would like to implement in your stream without going through all the hassle, I can help with that!</p>
                        <p><b> What I offer:</b></p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><b>Custom created buttons</b><br>
                            If LioranBoard supports it, I can make it happen for you! <br>
                            Optionally, I can also (roughly) explain the process of coding it and how it all works together.
                        <br>                     

                        </li>    
                        <li><b>Integrations with other applications and platforms </b><br>
                         <p> Is there anything you would like to control directly from LioranBoard? <br>
                         Maybe you would like your viewers to be able to interact with your music app. <br>Or retrieve, process and update data in Google Sheets. <br>
                         Or get notified of any new pledges on your Patreon.<br>
                         Or have new Discord posts displayed in your Twitch chat. <br>
                          Or be able to translate your incoming or outgoing chat messages in real time. <br>
                          Or how about triggering buttons with your voice? <br>
                        This and much more can all be done via custom made extensions.
