                    <p><b>Creator: </b>Lioran<br>
                    <b>Download:</b> Preinstalled. Located in <code>lioranboard/Extensions</code> folder</a><br>
                    <b>Description: </b>This extension is ready to be used as soon as you download LioranBoard, as it is preinstalled in your Transmitter. Twitch does not natively send follower alerts, so this is why there needs to be a separate extension to handle them. </p>
                    <p><i>(Skip these steps below if you installed Notification System as it is already included in it)</i></p>
                    <b><p>How to initiate the extension: </b><br>
                    <ol>
                    <li>Create a new button called <code>Init Follower Alert</code></li>
                    <li>Add a new command  <a href="othercommands.html#sendtoextension" target="_blank"> Send to Extension</a> - Follower Alert: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Do not modify<code>channel_id</code>value, unless you're using alternate accounts in LB. In that case you need to change it to your broadcaster's channel ID (which can be easily found by using <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/twitch-username-and-user/laonpoebfalkjijglbjbnkfndibbcoon" target="_blank">this</a> Chrome extension)</li>

                    </ul>
                                      
                    </li> 
                     <li>Click on Done. Right click on the newly created button and select <code>Add Twitch Triggers</code>. Click on the <code>+</code> - Extension Trigger. Set it to <code>!transmitteralways</code>. <br>This button will now get executed every time you refresh or close/reopen Transmitter, and will start listening for new followers. </li>
                    </ol></p>

                   <p> <b>How to set up a Follower trigger:</b><br>
                    <ol>
                    <li>Create a new button called <code>Follower Alert</code>. </li>
                     <li>Add a new command <a href="mathcommands.html#mathtriggerpull"  target="_blank"> Math: Trigger Pull </a>. Set <code>Variable</code> to follower_name and <code>Pull value</code> to 1.</li>
                    <li>Right click on the button and select <code>Add Twitch Triggers</code>. Click on the <code>+</code> - Extension Trigger. Set it to <code>Follower Alert</code>. The button will now get triggered every time the extension detects a new follower. <br>
                        We also recommend to check <code>Add to Request Queue</code>, which acts as a button queue. If there is another Follower Alert trigger event while the button is still active (for example if you get two followers at the same time), it will place it in the request queue and reactivate the button as soon as it's ready again. </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>And you're done! Every time you get a new follower, their name will be stored in the <code>follower_name</code> variable. You are free to add other commands to you Follower Alert button. For example, you can use the <a href="othercommands.html#twitchchatmessage"  target="_blank">
                        Twitch: Chat Message
                    </a> command to thank your new followers for joining your stream. </p>
                    <p><i>Note: The follower Alert is not instantaneous, as it periodically fetches Twitch data every 15-20 seconds. If you have a Streamlabs account, you can install a Streamlabs Alerts extension instead which also includes Follower Alert and has almost no delay. </i></p>

                    <b>Download:</b> Located in <code>lioranboard/LB Notification system</code> folder</a><br>
                    <b>Description: </b>LioranBoard comes with a fully functional notification animation system for Twitch, ready to use for OBS. <br>

                      <b>Setup Instructions</b>
                      <ol>
                      <li> Copy the whole LB Notification System folder to <code>LioranBoard Receiver(PC)\Ext</code>folder.</li>
                      <li> LioranBoard must be connected to OBS with 4.9 OBS Websocket installed. </li>
                      <li> Install the "LioranBoard Notification System.lbe" extension found in this directoy to your Transmitter. </li>
                      <li> There should be a new deck in your Receiver and a new scene in your OBS (which you can add as a source to your existing scenes). The notification system is not ready to be used. You can use the test buttons in your Receiver for various Twitch alerts.</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p>The notification system comes with a TTS system. The default TTS will only work if the Transmitter is running in Chrome. </p>
                      
                      <p><b>How to switch to Polly TTS</b> (and be able to use it in your OBS dock): 
                      <ol>
                          <li>Install the <a href="externalext.html#pollyTTS">Polly TTS extension</a>.</li>
                        <li>Go in the command list for "Master Animator" and "TTS voices" buttons and delete every command in there.</li>
                        <li>Go in the "Alternate Master Animator" button, click the check box at the top left to select every command and click "Copy selected commands"
                          and paste them in the normal Master Animator button.</li>
                        <li>Repeat step 4 for Alternate TTS voices.</li>
                        <li>The Polly TTS should now be fully integrated with your Notification system. </li>
                      </ol>
                      <p>
                      Note: If you have the <a href="https://github.com/christinna9031/LB-Streamlabs-Alerts">StreamLabs Alerts</a> extension installed, the notification system will pick up the donations by default. </p>

                        <b>Description: </b>You can use this extension to add as many timers as you want. Useful for triggering buttons (like sending chat messages) every X minutes. It is not precise to the second since it still needs to go through the websocket, so account for a variance of 5-10 seconds.   </p>

                                              </p>
                        <p>You can create as many timers as you want. The timers will clear only if you use Timer Stop extension, refresh Transmitter or close/reopen LB receiver.<br>
                        You can keep editing your decks and buttons and even reset values, as this has no effect on the timers whatsoever. </p>

                        <ol>
                        <li>Create a new button and add a command Send to extension - Timer. </li>    
                        <li>Enter the name of your timer. This will be the extension trigger that will fire each time your timer hits 0.</li>
                        <li>Enter the delay in milliseconds. If you want to trigger a button every 5 minutes, it will be 60000 * 5 = 300000.</li>
                        <li>Create another button or use an existing one you wish to trigger once the timer hits 0. Add a new extension trigger to the button which will be the name of your timer you set up in your previous step. </li>
                        <li>Click done twice and initiate your timer by pressing the first button you created (press it only once, otherwise it will create duplicate timers). </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                        <i>Note: You can see all your currently running timers in your Transmitter by clicking on the "View Active Timers" button. <button id="example" onclick="toggle_visibility('activetimersX')">Show example</button>

                        <li>Create a new button and add a new command Send to extension - Timer Delete.</li>
                        <li>The name will be the name of your timer you set up earlier (needs to match). StopAll can be either set to false (to only delete the specified timer) or true (to delete all currently running timers). </li>
                        </ol>

                        <b>Description: </b> This extension automatically creates a new deck and populates it with buttons that have predefined values so you don't have to manually create them one by one. The result can be something like <a  href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('massbuttonX');return false;">this</a>

                        <p>
                            List of all values you can configure: <br>
<ul>
<li> <b>deck file name</b> - be careful to NOT OVERRIDE an already existing deck. Check your local folder and choose a deck file name that does not exist yet (each deck is formatted like this: <code>configs/NUMBER/.ini</code>). Do not skip any numbers or LB will not load it up. For example, if your last deck file is <code>configs6.ini</code>, LB expects the next one to be <code>configs7.ini</code>. </li>
<li><b>deck background color</b> - use <a href="https://chrisanselmo.com/gmcolor" target="_blank">this</a> color picker (GML Raw value).</li>
<li><b>grid height and weight</b> - how many buttons you want each row and column to contain</li>
<li><b>default button color</b> - use <a href="https://chrisanselmo.com/gmcolor" target="_blank">this</a> color picker (GML Raw value). Applies to all the buttons.</li>
<li><b>default button text</b> - applies to all the buttons</li>
<li><b>default button image</b> - your image file name (do not include path). Needs to be located in <code>Lioranboard/Receiver/image</code> folder. Accepts .png files only. Applies to all the buttons. </li>
<li><b>button ID to start with</b> - choose non existing button ID.</li>
</ul>
<p>
After you fill out all the fields, press the button and let it do all the magic. It might take some time if you are creating a lot of buttons. Once it is done, you can restart LioranBoard and the new deck should appear in your deck menu. <br>
 If you do not see your new deck, you probably did not select the right name for your <code>configs/NUMBER/.ini</code> deck file. Go back to your local folder, look up the highest <code>configs/NUMBER/.ini</code> file (for example configs15.ini) and rename your newly created deck file in the same fashion (for example configs16.ini). Reopen LB and it should be there. </p>

<i>This extension is just one premade button with commands, it does not matter which Transmitter you choose to install it in.</i>

                        <b>Description: </b>This extension allows you scan a folder to retrieve all the file names and save them into a stack and .ini file. Very useful if you need to iterate through a lot files with different names and file types. <br>
 
                        <b>Setup: </b> 
                        Place the whole <code>Get_Folder_Files</code> folder into your <code>LioranBoard Receiver(PC)\Ext</code> folder. There is a <code>get_files.bat</code> file that will be executed from LioranBoard. You can (and should) right click on it-edit to see the cmd commands: <code>cd /d %1</code> navigates to your selected folder, <code>dir /b /a-d</code> outputs all the file names in the folder and <code>|clip</code> saves the output in your clipboard. Please make sure your antivirus did not delete or modify the batch file. </p>
                            <p>
                        Follow the premade button instructions and fill out the following values: 
                        <ol>
                        <li>
                        <code>folder_path</code> - full path to the folder which you wish to retrieve your file names from. "E:\Stream" or "E:/Stream" both work, but will be converted and saved as "E:/Stream".  
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        <code>ini_file</code> - name of the .ini file you wish to save your file names into. Will be created in lioranboard\LioranBoard Receiver(PC) folder if it doesn't exist. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        <code>filter_types</code> (optional) - a string of file types you wish to include, all other types will be ignored. Separated by comma. Example: "png,jpg,bmp"
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        <code>sort_order</code> - sort your stack either alphabetically or numerically
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        <code>save_as</code> - save the values either as file names (hello.png) or including the full path (E:/Stream/hello.png).
                        </li> 
                        </ol>

                       <p> Do not edit any other values. <br>
                        Once you press the button, it will take some time to execute, depending on the amount of files. If there are more than 500 files in your folder, LioranBoard might temporarily become unresponsive for up to several minutes. Just wait and let it do its own thing. Please note that there is a character limit, which corresponds to around 2000-3000 file names. It will not save all the files if it reaches the limit.  </p>
                      <p>  <b>Important:</b> Please do not use your clipboard to copy anything (CTRL+C) for at least 5 seconds just after you press the button. The button relies on clipboard functionality and it might not execute properly otherwise. 
                       <p>
                        Once the button is executed, all file names are saved in the specified .ini file, including their stringified stack and amount. Please note the paths in the .ini file will always contain forward slashes, even if you use backward slashes in your file_path value.               <button id="example" onclick="toggle_visibility('getfilesX')">Show example</button>
                        <div id="getfilesX" style="display: none;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/szdLpw2.png" /><br /></div>
          
                        
                       <p> You can use <a href="mathcommands.html#mathrandom">Math:Random</a> and <a href="filecommands.html#fileloadstring">File:Load String</a> commands to load a random file name, or you can use <a href="filecommands.html#fileloadstring">File:Load String</a> and <a href="stackcommands.html#stackparse">Stack:Parse</a> commands to load up the whole stack of file names. Make sure to use forward slashes in your section name. 
                        <button id="example" onclick="toggle_visibility('getfilesX2')">Show example</button>
                        <div id="getfilesX2" style="display: none;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/GZ81gBh.png" /><br /></div>
                        <p>If the contents of your scanned folder change, you can freely rescan the folder, which will automatically override the file names in your .ini file (and delete all non existing ones). </p>
                        <p>  If there are any errors, you should get a yellow notification message in your Receiver. <br>

                            After installing the extension, go to the premade deck to see all 6 button color format examples. <br>

                            <b>Note:</b><br> I previously released this extension under the name 'Color Code'. This new version fixes a bug where colors would not properly change in some OBS sources and adds new formats to work with. It is recommended to uninstall the old Color Code extension first.

                                    <p>This is an extremely useful extension if you need to switch&nbsp;to a different video resolution&nbsp;or you often create and share your scene collections with other people who&nbsp;need them for a&nbsp;different resolution.&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>If you've ever had to change all your pixel-size perfect scenes to another canvas size,&nbsp;you know how much of a hassle it was and how long it took you to get it all back to perfection. Not anymore, one button does it all!&nbsp;<br></p>
                                    <p>As a bonus, the extension should automatically resize&nbsp;your <strong >crop and move source filters</strong>, so you don't need to worry about manually doing that either.&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>It comes with a premade deck where you need to change only two values - your scene name and the original width you're resizing it from. After that you can just press the button and let all the magic happen.&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p><strong style="color:#D60000">Important note:</strong> &nbsp;Although the extension has been thoroughly tested, bugs sometimes happen! I strongly recommend duplicating your scene collection as a backup before using the extension.&nbsp;</p>
                                
                               <p> <b>Setup: </b> <br>
                                After installing the extension, go to the premade deck and edit the Resize button: 
                                <ul>
                                <li><code>SceneResize</code> - name of the scene you wish to resize. All sources, nested scenes and their sources will be resized. Crop and Move Source filters should be also correctly resized. </li>
                                <li><code>OrigWidth</code> - original width of the scene. For example, if you just switch from 720p to 1080p, the orignal width will be 1280.</li>
                                <li>Your current canvas width you're resizing your scene to will be automatically pulled from OBS. You do not need to set this one up.</li>
                                <li><code>obsws_port</code> - your OBS websocket port. Should be 4444 unless you changed it.</li>
                                <li><code>obsws_pw</code> - your OBS websocket password, if you set up any. Leave empty if you have no password.</li>
                                </ul>

                              <p>  Once you edit the Resize button, you can now proceed to press it. Don't forget to back up your scene collection first! 

                               <p><i> The extension automatically saves the last width you resized the scene to. If the saved value is different from what you manually entered, you might get a popup warning message. You can choose to edit the width value to match the one in the popup message, or ignore it and press the button again to proceed
                                with your manually entered width. This is just a safety net in case of any typos. </i>

                                           <p><b>If you're running Transmitter outside of OBS in a browser (for example in Chrome), make sure it's the active tab (i.e. you can actually see the Transmitter) when you press Create puzzle button.

                                       <p> <b>Setup: </b> <br>
                                        After installing the extension, go to the premade deck and follow these steps:

                                        <code>obsws_port</code> - your OBS Websocket Port. Default is 4444. 
                                        </li>
                                          <li>
                                        <code>puzzle_scene</code> - name for your NEW puzzle scene that will be created. Make sure it doesn't exist already. Please note there is a bug in OBS where if you delete a scene and try to recreate it without completely restarting OBS, it will tell you it already exists. 
                                        </li>

Can be your camera, random video, picture, etc. <Br> Please make sure you're not using overly oversized pictures or videos - their original size should not be much larger than your canvas in OBS for performance reasons.
                                        </li>

                                        <code>puzzle_columns</code> - number of columns you want your puzzle to have. Columns and rows affect the difficulty of puzzle and also its performance - older streaming machines might not be able to handle something crazy as 10x10 puzzle grid (which is 100 puzzle mirror sources your GPU has to animate!). 
                                        </li>

                                        <code>puzzle_border_thickness</code> - how thick the puzzle border should be in pixels. Depending on how much you're going to resize the puzzle scene, you might want to increase the border thickness. If you set it to 1 pixel, but resize your puzzle scene to 1/3 of its original size, the border will partially or completely disappear. Play around with it and see what works for your case the best.
                                        </li>

                                        <code>puzzle_border_margin</code> - this affects the space between the pieces if border is present. Again, different settings might be needed for different resolutions and grid size. 
                                        </li>

                                        <code>puzzle_text_size</code> - font size for the puzzle coordinates. This again depends on your much you resize your puzzle scene - increase/decrease the font size depending on your own settings.
                                        </li>

                                            1. You must be connected to Transmitter, OBS and be on the scene with the source you want to create your puzzle game from. Make sure the source isn't hidden. <br>
                                            2. If your Transmitter is running outside of OBS in a browser, make sure it's the <b>active tab</b>, otherwise the browser throttles its execution and it might take a while to create your puzzle. <br>
